## Custom Reward Function 1
This function provides a reward of 1 if the agent reaches the target state, which is state 15 in the FrozenLake environment. The reward indicates that the agent has successfully completed the task of reaching the goal.
## Custom Reward Function 2
This function gives a reward of 1 if the agent reaches state 15 (the target state). However, if the agent does not reach the target, it incurs a penalty of -1. This creates a balance between rewarding the agent for completing the task and penalizing it for not achieving the goal.
## Custom Reward Function 3
This function is similar to Custom Reward Function 1, where the agent receives a reward of 1 when it reaches state 15 (the target state), and no other changes are made to the reward structure. This function is simple and focuses on rewarding the agent for successfully reaching the goal.
